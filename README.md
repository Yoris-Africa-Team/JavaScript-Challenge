 A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up 
 to the top one at a time. VISUALGO. 
Before we sort, we must swap!. Most sorting algorithms involve 
some type of swapping functionality.(e.g swapping to numbers to 
put them in order). If our data is sorted well. burble sort works 
well.
Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger 
left half which is always stored. Sorting is fundamental. Bubble 
sort, selection sort and insertion sort are all roughly equivalent
All have average time complexities that are quadratic. We can do 
better...but we need more complex algorithms!. We sort based on 
priority.
